# Setting Up AppDynamics Service to Start Automatically After Reboot

## Background

In RHEL 7, the AppDynamics service uses `sudo` to run init scripts during startup. However, after upgrading to RHEL 8, organizational policies prohibit the use of persistent `sudo` permissions for these scripts. The team is required to transition to using `systemd` for service management.

This issue was raised with the vendor, who recommends reinstalling the init scripts packaged with the AppDynamics Controller using the `-p` (prune) or `-x` (sudo) wrapper. Additionally, you’ll need to change the security context of the init script to meet the required security settings.

The following instructions detail this process:

---

### Steps

1. **Navigate to the AppDynamics Init Script Directory**  
   Go to the directory where the init scripts are located:
   ```
   <Controller_Home>/controller-ha/init
   ```

2. **Uninstall the Current Init Scripts**  
   Run the `uninstall.sh` script to remove the existing init scripts from `init.d`:
   ```
   ./uninstall.sh
   ```

3. **Confirm Uninstallation**  
   Verify that the scripts have been removed from the `init.d` directory:
   ```
   ls /etc/init.d
   ```

4. **Reinstall the Scripts Using the `-x` Wrapper**  
   Install the scripts back using the `-x` wrapper:
   ```
   ./install-init.sh -x
   ```

5. **Verify Installation**  
   Navigate to `/etc/init.d` and run the following command to check the files:
   ```
   ls -lrZ
   ```

6. **Check the Security Context**  
   Review the security context of the `appdcommon.sh` script. The script should have `bin_t` permissions, but it might currently be set to `etc_t`. You can verify this using the `ls -lrZ` command.

7. **Change the Security Context**  
   Update the security context to `bin_t` by running:
   ```
   chcon -t bin_t appdcommon.sh
   ```

8. **Confirm the Change**  
   Verify the change by running the `ls -lrZ` command again to confirm that the `appdcommon.sh` script now has the correct security context.

9. **Reboot and Test**  
   Restart the system and verify that the AppDynamics Controller starts automatically:
   ```
   sudo reboot
   ```
